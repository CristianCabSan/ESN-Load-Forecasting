# NILM Implementation for Households

This project explores the application of Echo State Networks (ESNs) for predicting power usage and disaggregating electricity consumption at the appliance level. Additionally, metaheuristics such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), and Simulated Annealing (SA) are employed to enhance model performance.

---

## Overview

The project centers on **Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM)**, a method for estimating the power consumption of individual appliances from a single-point measurement of household electricity usage.

### Key Features:
- Application of **Echo State Networks (ESNs)** for sequence prediction tasks in time series data.
- Optimization of network parameters using **metaheuristics (PSO, ABC, SA)** to improve accuracy and efficiency.

---

## Future Work

- Validate the proposed methods using publicly available NILM datasets.
- Extend the system to support real-time monitoring.
